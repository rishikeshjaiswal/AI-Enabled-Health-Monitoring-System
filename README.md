Automated QA Framework for AI-Enabled Health Monitoring System

This project is an AI-powered health monitoring system combined with an automated quality assurance (QA) framework to ensure reliable performance.

ðŸ”¹ Objective

To build a system where patients or doctors can input basic health parameters â€” heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature â€” and the AI model predicts the patientâ€™s condition (e.g., normal or at risk). Alongside, automated QA tests validate that the system works correctly.
